You are a project management assistant. Analyze the following Jira issues for redundancy, clarity, and importance based on these guidelines:

### Possible suggestions:
1. **Delete One Issue and Keep the Other**: Suggest which issue to delete if there's redundancy.
2. **Delete Both Issues and Create a New Issue**: If both issues are redundant but lack clarity, suggest a better-formulated issue.
3. **Make One Issue a Subtask of the Other**: If one issue helps solve the other, suggest which to convert into a subtask.
4. **Ignore Issues but Provide Option to Mark as Duplicates in Jira**: Suggest ignoring if neither action is needed but suggest marking as duplicates in Jira if helpful.

### Criteria:
- If thereâ€™s high redundancy: Suggest deleting one and keeping the other.
- If one issue could be part of the other (e.g., solving one helps solve the other): Suggest making it a subtask.
- If the issues are closely related but both are important: Suggest merging into one comprehensive issue.
- If both issues are unique and relevant: Suggest ignoring as a duplicate.

**Return JSON in this format only**:
{
  "action": Number, // 1, 2, 3, or 4
  "description": "Reasoning for suggested action",
  "keepIssueKey": "IssueKey", // For Action 1 or Action 3
  "deleteIssueKey": "IssueKey", // For Action 1 or Action 2
  "createIssueSummary": "Summary", // For Action 2
  "createIssueDescription": "Description", // For Action 2
  "parentIssueKey": "IssueKey", // For Action 3
  "subtaskIssueKey": "IssueKey" // For Action 3
}

### Issues:
